        <h1>Introduction to Modern Mathematics, by Francisco Alcaraz</h1>
        <h2>Part 1: The Beginning of the Renaissance</h2>
        <p>Preceeding the Renaissance was a long period of time where not much intellectual progress was made. Some would trace this to 
            the horrific murder of <strong>Hypathia of Alexandria</strong>, a philosopher and the woman considered the very first female mathematician in history. As the persecuted <em>Christian</em>
            minority became the persecutorial majority, any attempts at resisting the conversion to Christianity was considered heretic, and Hypathia was no exception. Fearing that she would 
            be a danger to the rise of Christian power, a mob of fanatical Christians dragged her out to the streets, stabbed her with sharpened oyster shells, and tore her limbs to pieces,
            then proceeded to discard her remains in a fire. Thus came the end of intellectualism for some time.

        <h2>Part 2: The Renaissance</h2>
        <p>The Renaissance was a transformational period that changed the course of history and of mathematics forever. Some notable mathematicians include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rene Descartes</li>
            <li>Francois Viete</li>
            <li>Jean Jaques Rousseau</li>
            <li>George Harrison</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There were several important ideas and concepts brought about during this time that helped shape the modern mathematics we learn these days and also
            helped create the modern notation that is nearly universally adopted. Such concepts include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The <em>Cartesian</em> Plane</li>
            <li>Analytical Geometry</li>
            <li>Signs such as <strong>'<', '=', '+', '*'</strong></li>
            <li>Exponent Notation of Squares</li>
            <li>Modern Square Root notation</li>
        </ol>
